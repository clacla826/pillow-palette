// 1.Issue: main index.js didn't run when i simply 'npm start'
//   solution: npm run start-dev by running both webpack -w and noder server


//Questions
What does .babelrc does and relation o webpack.config.js presets?


//Take away 
Setting up: make sure every components are connected by exports and inports
Also, make sure your mind map is logially working together.
App to Root to Component and than your redux is exporting and store is creating the state based on those hookups
//Webpack config is very important. If it says module not found or can't resolve
  Check your webpack config to see if you have:
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['.js', '.jsx']
  },
